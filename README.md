This was the 1st game I ever wrote on Python. Learnt it from Tech With Tim on Youtube from his 3 Mini Python Projects - For Beginners.

Here are the instructions - 
The Pig Dice Game is a simple, fun dice game where players race to reach 50 points. Here's how to play:

Objective:
Be the first player to score 50 points.

What You Need:
Number of Players: 2 or more.

Game Setup:
Choose the starting player (you can roll the dieâ€”highest roller goes first).
The game is played in turns, with each player rolling the die multiple times per turn to accumulate points.

How to Play:
On Your Turn:

- Type in 'Yes' if you want to Roll the die.
- The result will be stored and displayed automatically.
- You can choose to either:
- Roll again to accumulate more points, OR
- Hold and add your turn total to your overall score. This ends your turn.

Rolling a 1:
If you roll a 1, your turn is over, and your turn total is lost! You score 0 points for that turn.

The first player to reach or exceed 50 points wins the game.
